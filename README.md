# Football game using Unity
###### By Kristian Hadberg

## What works:
- All mandatory / basic features
- 'Story line' optional feature implemented
- 'Streaker' optional feature implemented
- 'Player two' feature implemented (needs a bit of polish though)
- 'Camera toggle' feature implemented

## Controls
> **Arrow keys** to move
>
> **Spacebar** to kick the ball (when player is in control of the ball)
>
> **Shift** to sprint
>
> **C** to toggle camera between player & ball 
>
> **S** to change player in levels with more players
